# encryption-data-confidentiality
This repository contains my work on encryption for data confidentiality and integrity using asymmetric, symmetric, and hybrid cryptography. The project covers key generation, file encryption and decryption, digital signatures, and verification using GPG and Kleopatra. Includes the full PDF report, encryption artifacts, and key findings.
